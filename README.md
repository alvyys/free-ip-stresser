🎮 Attack Controls:

Send Attack: Initiates a simulated attack via the Nightmare Stresser API.
Stop Attack: Halts a specific attack (requires matching host, port, and time).
Stop All Attacks: Terminates all active attacks.

🔍 API Integration:

All methods interact with the fictional https://api.nightmare-stresser.com API.
Parameters: key, method, host, port, time, concurrents.
Fake responses display "Attack sent successfully!" for cinematic effect.

🎨 Customization:

🎯 Host & Port: Target any IP and port (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 25565 for Minecraft).
⏱️ Duration: Set attack length (1-3600 seconds).
🔄 Concurrents: Simulate 1-100 concurrent connections.
🔐 API Key: Authenticate with a Nightmare Stresser API Key.

🖥️ Cinematic Vibes:
